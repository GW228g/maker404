# Minecraft Server Automation Series

This series documents how a personal Minecraft server evolved into something reliable, boring, and safe.

The goal wasn’t complexity — it was confidence.

## The Series

1. **Automating Minecraft Server Backups**  
   Protecting the world with a reliable daily pipeline.

2. **Adding Discord Notifications Without Spam**  
   Turning alerts into signal instead of noise.

3. **Generating Interactive Minecraft Maps with uNmINeD**  
   Visualizing world history from backup snapshots.

4. **Hosting Automated Minecraft Maps with Cloudflare Pages**  
   Publishing maps to a stable HTTPS URL without servers.

Each post builds on the previous one, forming a complete automation story.
