  <h1>Welcome to Maker404</h1>
  <p>Project not found? No worries — we're here to help K–6 tech teachers bring creativity, challenge, and fun to every classroom.</p>
  
  <p>Whether you're a brand-new tech teacher wondering where to start, a makerspace facilitator looking for quick project ideas, or an experienced educator exploring new tools, you're in the right place. We believe technology education works best when it's hands-on, failure-friendly, and rooted in curiosity across both school and home projects.</p>
  
  <p>Our resources are designed for real classrooms with real constraints—limited budgets, limited time, and students with varying skill levels. From cardboard and tape to micro:bits and coding, we focus on what actually works with elementary students.</p>
