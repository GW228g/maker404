## New to Tech or Makerspace Teaching?

Welcome! If you're here, you're probably wondering how to bring technology and making into your elementary classroom—and maybe feeling a little overwhelmed by all the tools, platforms, and possibilities out there.

I get it. I've been there.

### Teaching Technology as a Journey, Not a Destination

Here's what I've learned after years of teaching tech to K-6 students: **the best tech teachers aren't the ones who know everything—they're the ones who are curious about everything.**

Technology isn't something we master once and check off a list. It's constantly evolving. New tools emerge. Old platforms change. What worked last year might not work this year. And that's actually the exciting part.

I approach technology—both in my classroom and at home—as a continuous learning journey. When I discover a new tool or idea, I experiment with it. I build things. I break things. I learn alongside my students and my own children. And that modeling of curiosity, iteration, and growth mindset? That's the real lesson.

### From Curiosity to Creation: Building Real Tools

Some of my best teaching moments haven't come from following a curriculum—they've come from solving real problems with technology.

**For example:** I coach my kid's basketball team and was frustrated trying to manage fair playing time during games. Instead of downloading some complicated app, I thought: *What if I just built exactly what I need?*

So I did. I created a [basketball rotation planner](https://rotations.maker404.com) using web technologies I was already teaching—HTML, CSS, JavaScript. It works offline, runs on any device, and solves the exact problem I had. My students saw me build it. They saw me test it, fix bugs, and iterate on the design. They saw that technology isn't magic—it's just problem-solving with tools.

**Another example:** I wanted a safe, simple pixel art tool for my elementary students—something with no accounts, no ads, no data collection. Nothing on the market fit exactly what I needed. So I built [Pixel Studio](https://pixel-studio.maker404.com), a free web app designed specifically for kids ages 6-11.

These projects weren't just about creating tools. They were about showing my students (and my own children) that **ideas can become real**. That with curiosity, some basic skills, and willingness to try (and fail, and try again), you can build solutions to actual problems.

### What This Means for Your Classroom

You don't need to be a programmer or tech expert to teach technology effectively. You need to be willing to:

- **Explore new tools** alongside your students
- **Model curiosity** by asking "what if?" and "how does this work?"
- **Embrace productive failure** and show students that mistakes are part of learning
- **Start small** with simple, hands-on projects that work with basic materials
- **Connect technology to real problems** students care about

The tools and platforms will keep changing. But the mindset—curiosity, iteration, creative problem-solving—that's timeless.

### Quick Start: Your First Steps

If you're new to tech or makerspace teaching, here's how to get started with confidence:

**1. Start with one hands-on activity per week**  
Don't try to overhaul your entire curriculum. Pick one simple maker challenge—like our [Straw Tower Challenge](/404-challenges/straw-tower-challenge/) or [Paper Clip Chain Reaction](/404-challenges/paper-clip-chain-reaction/)—and try it. See what your students create. Learn from what works (and what doesn't).

**2. Use simple, accessible materials**  
You don't need expensive robotics kits to teach making and technology. Paper, tape, cardboard, string, and recycled materials can teach the same design thinking, problem-solving, and iteration skills. Check our [Supply Checklist](/downloads/Tech-Teacher-Supply-Checklist.pdf) for what to stock.

**3. Lean on curiosity, not expertise**  
It's okay—actually, it's *better*—to say "I don't know, let's figure it out together!" Students learn more when they see adults modeling the learning process, not just delivering answers.

**4. Try our 404 Challenges**  
Our [404 Challenges](/404-challenges/) are designed to be low-prep, failure-friendly, and flexible. They work in 30-45 minute sessions and encourage creative problem-solving over perfect results. Start with one and see where it takes your class.

**5. Connect with community**  
Teaching technology can feel isolating, especially if you're the only tech teacher in your building. You're not alone. Use our [contact form](/contact/) to reach out with questions, share what's working in your classroom, or request resources.

### The Real Goal: Growth Mindset Through Making

At the end of the day, we're not teaching students to be software engineers or robotics experts (though some might become those things). We're teaching them to approach problems with curiosity, to iterate when things don't work, to believe they can learn new things, and to see technology as a tool for solving real problems—not magic that only "tech people" understand.

That mindset applies far beyond the makerspace. It's how we navigate a changing world.

So welcome. Wherever you are in your tech teaching journey, you're in the right place. Start small. Stay curious. Learn with your students.

And if you build something cool—whether it's a cardboard creature or a web app—[let us know](/contact/). We'd love to hear about it.
