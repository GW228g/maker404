# Paper Clip Chain Reaction

**Grade Level:** K-6 (adaptable)  
**Time:** 30-45 minutes  
**Group Size:** 2-4 students per team

## Materials Needed (per team):
- 25-30 paper clips
- 10-15 popsicle sticks
- 10-15 rubber bands
- Tape (masking or scotch)
- Optional: small cup or container as a target

## The Challenge:
Build a chain reaction machine where one paper clip triggers the next in a domino-style sequence. The goal is to create the longest possible chain reaction that runs from start to finish without stopping.

## Step-by-Step Instructions:

### Setup (5 minutes):
1. Clear a workspace - students will need a flat surface like a table or the floor
2. Distribute materials to each team
3. Show students a simple example: bend a paper clip into an L-shape, stand it up, and knock it over to hit the next one

### Building Phase (25-30 minutes):

**For Younger Students (K-2):**
1. Start simple - line up 5 paper clips standing on end like dominoes
2. Practice knocking the first one to trigger the others
3. Add more clips to make the chain longer
4. Try bending clips into different shapes (L, S, zigzag)
5. Use tape to attach clips to popsicle sticks for stability

**For Older Students (3-6):**
1. Plan your chain reaction path - sketch it out first
2. Experiment with different trigger mechanisms:
   - Paper clips as falling dominoes
   - Rubber bands stretched between popsicle sticks (release creates motion)
   - Paper clips attached to sticks that swing when hit
   - Clips linked together that pull when one falls
3. Create "stations" where one mechanism triggers the next
4. Test each section before connecting them all
5. Add a finale - knock over a cup, ring a bell, or trigger a final dramatic fall

### Teacher Facilitation Tips:
- Walk around and ask: "What happens when this falls? What will it hit next?"
- If a team is stuck, suggest they start with just 3-4 clips and get that working first
- Encourage testing early and often - don't build the whole thing before testing!
- Remind students that failure is part of the process - engineers test and redesign

### Testing Phase (10 minutes):
1. Each team runs their chain reaction
2. Count how many "triggers" work in sequence (1 clip hitting another = 1 trigger)
3. If it stops, discuss why and allow 3 minutes for repairs
4. Run final demonstrations

## Learning Objectives:
- **Cause and effect:** Understanding that each action triggers the next
- **Engineering design process:** Plan, build, test, improve
- **Problem-solving:** Troubleshooting why the chain stops
- **Physics:** Gravity, momentum, and energy transfer

## Differentiation:
- **Easier:** Use only paper clips as dominoes (no rubber bands or complex mechanisms)
- **Harder:** Require at least 3 different types of mechanisms in the chain
- **Extension:** Add a specific target the chain reaction must accomplish (knock a ball into a cup, ring a bell, etc.)

## Discussion Questions:
- What made your chain reaction stop? How did you fix it?
- Which mechanism transferred energy the best?
- If you did this again, what would you change?
