**Grade Level:** 3-6  
**Time:** 60 minutes  
**Group Size:** 2-3 students per team

## Materials Needed (per team):
- 50-75 popsicle sticks
- White glue or glue sticks (hot glue for older students with supervision)
- 2 stacks of books or boxes (for bridge supports)
- Weights for testing (pennies, washers, or small weights)
- Ruler or measuring tape
- Small cup or container (to hold weights during testing)
- Paper towels (for glue cleanup)

## The Challenge:
Design and build a bridge that spans a 12-inch gap using only popsicle sticks and glue. Your bridge must support as much weight as possible. The team whose bridge holds the most weight before breaking wins!

## Learning Objectives:
- **Structural engineering:** Understanding how bridges distribute weight
- **Compression and tension:** Forces acting on bridge structures
- **Truss systems:** Why triangles make bridges stronger
- **Load testing:** Scientific method of testing to failure
- **Real-world connections:** How actual bridges are designed

## Setup (10 minutes):

### Create Testing Stations:
1. Place two stacks of books or boxes exactly 12 inches apart
2. This creates the "gap" your bridge must span
3. Have weights ready for testing (pennies work great—each weighs about 2.5 grams)
4. Set up a "loading platform" (small cup that will sit on top of the bridge to hold weights)

### Show Examples:
Display photos of real bridges:
- Golden Gate Bridge (suspension)
- Brooklyn Bridge (cable-stayed)
- Simple truss bridge
Point out the triangular support structures in each

## Building Phase (35-40 minutes):

### Planning (10 minutes):
Have teams sketch their bridge design BEFORE building:
1. Will it be flat or arched?
2. What will support the weight underneath?
3. How will they connect the sticks?

**Key Teaching Point:** "Real engineers always design before building. Your sketch doesn't have to be perfect, but it helps you think through problems before you start gluing."

### Building Strategies:

**Option 1: Simple Beam Bridge (Easier - Grades 3-4)**
1. Glue 5-6 popsicle sticks side-by-side to create a wide "road"
2. Add sticks underneath as supports (vertical and diagonal)
3. Test early to see where it's weak
4. Add more supports where needed

**Option 2: Truss Bridge (Advanced - Grades 5-6)**
1. Create two parallel "rails" from popsicle sticks
2. Connect them with triangular trusses (use triangle shapes for strength)
3. Add a "roadway" on top
4. The triangles distribute weight much more effectively than rectangles

### Engineering Tips:

**Triangles Are Your Friend:**
Show students that:
- A square made of sticks can be pushed and collapsed
- A triangle made of sticks is rigid and strong
- Real bridges use lots of triangles for this reason

**Joints Are Critical:**
- Where sticks connect is where bridges break
- Use plenty of glue at joints
- Overlap sticks for stronger connections
- Let glue dry for a few minutes before testing

**Test As You Go:**
Don't wait until the end! Place the bridge across the gap every 10 minutes to check:
- Does it sag in the middle?
- Does it wobble?
- Where does it seem weak?

## Testing Phase (15 minutes):

### Official Load Test:

**Setup:**
1. Place bridge across the 12-inch gap
2. Put small cup or container on the center of the bridge
3. Carefully add weights one at a time
4. Count how many weights the bridge holds before breaking

**Safety Note:** When testing, have students stand back in case the bridge collapses suddenly.

**Scoring Options:**
- **By Weight:** Most weight held wins
- **Efficiency:** Weight held divided by popsicle sticks used (lightest bridge that holds most wins)
- **Aesthetics Award:** Separate prize for most creative/beautiful design

### Record Results:
Create a class chart:
- Team name
- Number of popsicle sticks used
- Weight held (count pennies or weigh total)
- Design type (beam, arch, truss)

## Discussion Questions:

**After Testing:**
- What design held the most weight? Why do you think that worked?
- Where did most bridges break? (Usually the center or the joints)
- How did triangular supports help?
- What would you do differently if you built another bridge?

**Real-World Connections:**
- Why do real bridges have triangular supports underneath?
- What forces are acting on a bridge when a car drives over it?
- How do engineers test bridges before opening them to traffic?
- Why are some bridges arched and others flat?

## Differentiation:

### For Younger Students (Grade 3):
- Reduce the gap to 8 inches
- Allow 75 popsicle sticks instead of 50
- Focus on building something that spans the gap, not maximum weight
- Celebrate any bridge that holds at least 10 pennies

### For Older Students (Grades 5-6):
- Limit to 40 popsicle sticks
- Require specific design (must include triangular trusses)
- Calculate efficiency ratio (weight held ÷ sticks used)
- Research a specific famous bridge and try to replicate its design

### Extension Challenges:
1. **Arch Bridge:** Build a bridge with an arched roadway
2. **Suspension Bridge:** Add "cables" made from string to support the roadway from above
3. **Draw Bridge:** Create a section that can lift up to allow tall ships to pass
4. **Multi-Span Bridge:** Bridge across a 24-inch gap with a support in the middle

## Common Problems & Solutions:

| Problem | Why It Happens | Solution |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| Bridge sags in middle | Not enough support underneath | Add triangular trusses under the center |
| Bridge twists/wobbles | Sides aren't rigid | Add cross-bracing (diagonal sticks) |
| Bridge breaks at edges | Weight isn't distributed | Extend sticks further onto the supports |
| Sticks won't stay glued | Not enough glue or drying time | Use more glue, wait longer, or use tape temporarily while glue dries |
| Bridge too heavy | Used too many sticks | Focus on strategic placement of supports, not covering every space |

## Real-World Bridge Types:

**Beam Bridge:** Simplest design - flat roadway supported from below (highway overpasses)

**Arch Bridge:** Curved design that pushes weight outward to supports (Roman aqueducts)

**Truss Bridge:** Uses triangular frameworks for support (railroad bridges)

**Suspension Bridge:** Cables hang from tall towers to support the roadway (Golden Gate Bridge)

**Cable-Stayed Bridge:** Cables go directly from towers to roadway (modern city bridges)

## Science Behind Bridges:

**Compression:** Force pushing/squeezing (top of bridge when weight is added)

**Tension:** Force pulling/stretching (bottom of bridge when weight is added)

**Load Distribution:** Spreading weight across multiple support points so no single point holds everything

**Why Triangles?** Triangles can't change shape without breaking. Squares and rectangles can be pushed into parallelograms. This makes triangles the strongest shape for structures.

## Assessment Ideas:

**Participation:** Did students work collaboratively and stay on task?

**Engineering Process:** Did they sketch first, test as they built, and make improvements?

**Final Product:** Does the bridge span the gap? How much weight did it hold?

**Reflection:** Can students explain what worked, what didn't, and what they'd change?

## Materials Note:

**Cost:** Popsicle sticks are cheap! A box of 500 costs about $5-10. White glue is inexpensive. This is a budget-friendly challenge.

**Reuse:** Unless you want to preserve winning bridges, you can break them apart and reuse sticks for future projects.

**Alternatives:** Can't find popsicle sticks? Try:
- Straws (tape or glue together)
- Cardboard strips
- Pasta (dry spaghetti or fettuccine - surprisingly strong!)

## Extension: Connect to Math

**Calculate Load Ratios:**
If a bridge uses 50 sticks and holds 100 pennies, what's the stick-to-penny ratio?

**Measure Deflection:**
How much does the bridge sag in the center when weight is added? Measure with a ruler.

**Graph Results:**
Create a bar graph showing each team's results. Which design type performed best on average?

**This challenge connects directly to real-world engineering.** Every bridge students cross—from highway overpasses to footbridges to massive suspension bridges—uses these same principles of compression, tension, and load distribution.

When students see triangular trusses under a railroad bridge or an arched support in a parking garage, they'll recognize the engineering they learned by building with popsicle sticks.

That's the power of hands-on challenges. The learning sticks because the experience was real.
