# Straw Tower Challenge

**Grade Level:** K-6  
**Time:** 30-45 minutes  
**Group Size:** 2-4 students per team

## Materials Needed (per team):
- 25 plastic or paper straws (all the same size)
- 1 roll of masking tape (share 1 roll per 2-3 teams)
- Ruler or measuring tape
- Scissors (optional)
- Timer

## The Challenge:
Build the tallest free-standing tower using only straws and tape. The tower must stand on its own for at least 10 seconds without anyone touching it or holding it up.

## Step-by-Step Instructions:

### Setup (5 minutes):
1. Define the "building zone" - a flat area about 2 feet x 2 feet per team
2. Distribute 25 straws and tape to each team
3. Show the measuring tool students will use
4. Explain the 10-second rule: after building, hands off, and it must stand for 10 seconds

### Planning Phase (5 minutes):
1. Give teams 5 minutes to discuss their strategy
2. Encourage them to think about:
   - What shapes are strong? (triangles are strongest!)
   - Should the base be wide or narrow?
   - How will they connect straws together?

### Building Phase (20-25 minutes):

**Basic Techniques to Teach:**

1. **Connecting Straws:**
   - Pinch one end of a straw flat and insert it into another straw
   - Use small pieces of tape to secure joints
   - Create longer pieces by connecting 2-3 straws end-to-end

2. **Building a Strong Base:**
   - Start with a wide base (triangle or square shape)
   - Tape the base firmly to the table OR make it heavy with extra straws
   - A wider base = more stable tower

3. **Adding Height:**
   - Build vertical supports from each corner of the base
   - Connect vertical supports with horizontal straws for stability
   - Add cross-braces (diagonal straws) to prevent wobbling

**Age-Appropriate Approaches:**

**Younger Students (K-2):**
- Focus on building a simple pyramid or triangle structure
- Help them tape the base to the table for stability
- Celebrate towers of any height that stand for 10 seconds

**Older Students (3-6):**
- Challenge them to NOT tape the base to the table
- Require use of geometric shapes (triangles, squares)
- Encourage cross-bracing and engineering principles

### Teacher Tips:
- Around minute 10, call "halfway point!" and have teams measure current height
- Remind students: it's better to have a shorter, stable tower than a tall, wobbly one
- If a tower keeps falling, suggest adding more support at the base
- Watch for tape-heavy designs - challenge students to use straws cleverly, not just tape

### Testing Phase (10 minutes):
1. Call "5 minutes remaining!"
2. At time, all hands off
3. Measure each tower from base to highest point
4. Tower must stand for 10 seconds to count
5. Record heights on the board

## Learning Objectives:
- **Geometry:** Understanding triangles, squares, and 3D shapes
- **Structural engineering:** Base support, height vs. stability, bracing
- **Problem-solving:** Why did it fall? How can we fix it?
- **Measurement:** Using rulers, comparing heights

## Differentiation:
- **Easier:** Allow 30-35 straws; allow tape on base to secure to table
- **Harder:** Limit to 20 straws; tower must hold a small object (like a ping pong ball) on top
- **Extension:** Add a "wind test" - use a fan or blow on it gently. Still must stand 10 seconds

## Discussion Questions:
- What shapes did you use? Why?
- Where did your tower break or fall? What does that tell you?
- If you could redesign it, what would you do differently?
- What real buildings or structures use similar designs?

## Common Problems & Solutions:
- **Tower keeps tipping:** Base is too small - make it wider
- **Tower wobbles:** Add diagonal cross-braces
- **Straws sliding apart:** Use more tape at joints, or pinch/flatten ends before inserting
- **Too much tape, not enough straws:** Remind students tape is a connector, not the structure
