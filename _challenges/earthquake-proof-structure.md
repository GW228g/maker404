title: "Earthquake-Proof Structure Challenge"
date: 2026-02-13
---

**Grade Level:** 3-6  
**Time:** 60 minutes  
**Group Size:** 2-3 students per team

## Materials Needed (per team):
- 30-40 large marshmallows (standard size, not mini)
- 50-60 toothpicks
- 1 disposable aluminum foil pan or shallow tray (9" x 9" or similar)
- Jello (prepared and set in pan) OR 2 cups of marbles/dried beans in pan
- Ruler for measuring height
- Paper and pencil for recording data

## The Challenge:

Build the tallest possible structure that can survive an earthquake simulation. Your structure must:
- Stand on a "shaky foundation" (pan filled with jello or marbles)
- Survive 10 seconds of shaking (earthquake simulation)
- The taller your structure, the more points you earn—BUT it must survive to count!

## Learning Objectives:

- **Seismic engineering:** How buildings resist earthquake forces
- **Base isolation:** Why flexible foundations help structures survive
- **Center of gravity:** Understanding stability and height
- **Risk vs reward:** Balancing ambition (height) with practicality (stability)
- **Real-world connections:** Earthquake-resistant design in California, Japan, Chile

## Setup (10 minutes):

### Prepare Shake Tables:
**Option A: Jello Base (More Realistic)**
1. Make jello following package directions (do this before class)
2. Pour into aluminum pans and refrigerate until firm
3. This creates a wobbly foundation that mimics ground movement during earthquakes

**Option B: Marble Base (Easier Prep)**
1. Fill aluminum pans with 1-2 inches of marbles or dried beans
2. Structures sit on top of moving marbles
3. Simulates unstable ground

### Demonstration:
Show videos of:
- Buildings swaying during earthquakes
- Earthquake-resistant buildings in Tokyo or San Francisco
- The famous Taipei 101 building with its tuned mass damper

**Key Point:** "Real buildings in earthquake zones are designed to SWAY, not stay rigid. Rigid buildings crack and fall. Flexible buildings survive."

## Building Phase (30 minutes):

### Planning (5 minutes):
Have teams discuss:
- How tall should we build? (Taller = more points but harder to stabilize)
- What shape is most stable? (Wide base? Triangular? Square?)
- Should we make it flexible or rigid?

**Engineering Insight:** "Marshmallows and toothpicks create FLEXIBLE joints—perfect for earthquake resistance. If you make it too rigid, it will topple. If you make it too wobbly, it will collapse. Find the balance."

### Building Strategies:

**Option 1: Pyramid Design (Stable, Shorter)**
1. Create a wide square base (4x4 marshmallows)
2. Build up in layers, each layer smaller than the one below
3. Forms a pyramid shape
4. Very stable, but limited height

**Pros:** Unlikely to fall  
**Cons:** Won't score maximum points for height

**Option 2: Tower Design (Taller, Riskier)**
1. Create a small base (2x2 or 3x3 marshmallows)
2. Build straight up as high as possible
3. Add diagonal cross-bracing for stability

**Pros:** Maximum height if it survives  
**Cons:** More likely to topple during shaking

**Option 3: Wide Base Tower (Best of Both)**
1. Build a wide stable base (4x4 or 5x5)
2. Tower up from center
3. Add triangular supports connecting tower to base

**Pros:** Good balance of height and stability  
**Cons:** Uses more materials

### Building Tips:

**Triangles for Strength:**
- Connect toothpicks in triangular patterns
- Triangles don't collapse under pressure (unlike squares)
- Use triangular bracing on all sides

**Wide Base = Stable:**
- Think of the Eiffel Tower: wide base, narrow top
- The lower the center of gravity, the harder it is to tip over
- If your structure is wobbly when you place it, it will fall during shaking

**Test Before Earthquake:**
- Gently tap the pan before official testing
- If it immediately falls, rebuild with more stability
- Don't wait until the official test to discover problems!

**Marshmallow Placement:**
- Push toothpicks all the way through marshmallows
- Marshmallows create flexible joints (good for earthquakes!)
- Don't eat the marshmallows during building (save for after!)

## Earthquake Simulation (15 minutes):

### Testing Protocol:

**Setup:**
1. Measure structure height from base of pan to highest point
2. Record height on scoring sheet
3. Place structure in center of jello/marble pan

**Earthquake Simulation:**
1. Teacher holds pan with both hands
2. Shake horizontally back and forth (like shaking a gift box)
3. Start gently for 3 seconds, increase intensity for 7 seconds
4. Total shake time: 10 seconds

**Survival Criteria:**
- Structure must remain standing after shaking stops
- Some pieces can fall off, but main structure must be upright
- If it tips over or collapses, it doesn't count (height = 0 points)

### Scoring System:

**Height Points:**
- 0-6 inches: 10 points
- 7-12 inches: 20 points
- 13-18 inches: 30 points
- 19+ inches: 40 points

**Survival Bonus:**
- Structure survives = points earned
- Structure falls = 0 points (no matter how tall it was)

**Optional Categories:**
- "Tallest Survivor" award
- "Most Creative Design" award  
- "Engineering Excellence" (best balance of height + stability)

## Discussion Questions:

**Before Testing:**
- What do you think will happen when your structure shakes?
- Is your structure designed to be rigid or flexible? Why?
- What's your strategy: go tall and risky, or short and safe?

**After Testing:**
- What happened to the tallest structures?
- Which design strategy worked best?
- How did the flexible marshmallow joints help (or hurt)?
- What would you change if you built another one?

**Real-World Connections:**
- Why do buildings in California look different from buildings in Connecticut?
- How do engineers make skyscrapers earthquake-proof?
- What is a "tuned mass damper" and how does it work?

## Differentiation:

### For Younger Students (Grade 3):
- Focus on building something that stands, not maximum height
- Demonstrate a simple pyramid design they can copy
- Celebrate any structure that survives, regardless of height
- Gentle earthquake simulation

### For Older Students (Grades 5-6):
- Require calculation of height-to-base ratio
- Challenge: Build exactly 18 inches tall (precision engineering)
- Use stronger earthquake simulation
- Require written explanation of their design choices

### Extension Challenges:

**Add Mass Test:**
Place a small weight (marble or penny) on top of structure before shaking. Can it survive with extra weight?

**Aftershock Test:**
Structures that survive first earthquake face a second, stronger shake.

**Limited Materials:**
Use only 20 marshmallows and 30 toothpicks. Forces strategic material use.

**Specific Design Requirement:**
Must include a "building" (enclosed space with roof) on top of structure.

## Science Behind Earthquakes & Engineering:

### What Causes Earthquakes:
- Earth's crust is made of large plates that move
- When plates grind against each other, pressure builds
- Sudden release of pressure = earthquake
- Ground shakes horizontally AND vertically

### Engineering Solutions:

**Base Isolation:**
- Building sits on flexible bearings that absorb ground movement
- Ground shakes, building stays relatively still
- (Marshmallow joints mimic this!)

**Flexible Design:**
- Buildings designed to sway during earthquakes
- Steel frames bend but don't break
- Better to sway than crack

**Counterweight Systems:**
- Taipei 101 has a giant pendulum inside
- When building sways one way, pendulum swings opposite direction
- Cancels out movement

**Strong Foundation:**
- Wide base distributes weight
- Deeper foundations anchor building
- (Wide marshmallow base mimics this!)

## Real-World Earthquake Engineering:

**Show photos/videos of:**

**Transamerica Pyramid (San Francisco):**
- Pyramid shape for stability
- Flexible steel frame
- Survived 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake with minimal damage

**Taipei 101 (Taiwan):**
- 101-story skyscraper in earthquake zone
- 730-ton tuned mass damper on 88th-92nd floors
- Sways during earthquakes but stays upright

**Tokyo Buildings (Japan):**
- Many buildings on shock-absorbing bases
- Flexible design philosophy
- Regular earthquake drills

## Common Problems & Solutions:

| Problem | Why It Happens | Solution |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| Structure immediately falls when placed | Base too small or top-heavy | Wider base, shorter height, or move weight lower |
| Structure leans before shaking | Not built straight up | Check for vertical alignment while building |
| Top breaks off during shaking | Weak connection between base and tower | Reinforce with triangular bracing |
| Whole structure slides across pan | No connection to base | Push toothpicks into jello/marbles slightly |
| Marshmallows split | Toothpicks inserted too roughly | Insert gently, or use slightly stale marshmallows (firmer) |

## Math & Data Integration:

**Measurement:**
- Measure height in inches and centimeters
- Calculate height-to-base ratio
- Compare winning heights across teams

**Data Collection:**
Create a class chart:
- Team name
- Structure height (before shaking)
- Design type (pyramid, tower, etc.)
- Survived? (Yes/No)
- Points earned

**Graphing:**
- Bar graph: Height of each structure
- Pie chart: What percentage survived vs. fell?
- Line graph: If doing multiple tests, show improvement over time

## Connection to Other Subjects:

**Geography:**
- Map tectonic plates
- Identify earthquake-prone regions
- Compare building codes in California vs. Florida

**History:**
- 1906 San Francisco earthquake
- 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami
- How building techniques evolved after major quakes

**Current Events:**
- Recent earthquakes in the news
- International cooperation on earthquake-resistant design
- How engineers help after natural disasters

## Materials Note:

**Cost:**
- Marshmallows: ~$3-4 per bag (makes 3-4 structures)
- Toothpicks: ~$2 per box (makes many structures)
- Jello: ~$1 per box
- Aluminum pans: ~$5 for pack of 10
- Total per team: ~$3

**Alternatives:**
- Use gumdrops instead of marshmallows
- Use straws and clay balls instead of toothpicks and marshmallows
- Use a cookie sheet with dried beans instead of aluminum pan

**Reuse:**
- Marshmallows can't be reused (students may eat them!)
- Toothpicks can be saved if not broken
- Jello can be reused multiple times if refrigerated

## Why This Challenge Resonates:

**Real-World Relevance:** Every student has heard of earthquakes. This makes abstract engineering concepts tangible.

**Built-In Tension:** The height vs. stability trade-off creates genuine engineering dilemmas. Go tall and risky? Or safe and short?

**Immediate Feedback:** The shake test provides instant, dramatic results. Either it stands or it doesn't—no ambiguity.

**Teaches Failure Management:** Most structures will fall. That's okay! The question is: what did you learn? How will you build it differently next time?

**Connects to Current Events:** When earthquakes are in the news, students remember this challenge and understand why some buildings survive while others don't.

When students see news coverage of an earthquake, they'll look at the buildings that stayed standing and think: "I bet those have wide bases and flexible frames—just like my marshmallow tower."

That's when you know the learning stuck.
