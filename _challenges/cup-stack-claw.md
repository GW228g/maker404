**Grade Level:** 2-6  
**Time:** 45-60 minutes  
**Group Size:** 2-4 students per team

## Materials Needed (per team):
- 10-15 popsicle sticks
- 2-3 yards of string or yarn
- 4-6 rubber bands
- Tape (masking or duct)
- Scissors
- Cardboard scraps (optional, for reinforcement)
- 3 plastic or paper cups (solo cups work great)

## The Challenge:
Design and build a mechanical claw that can pick up and stack 3 cups without touching them with your hands. The claw must be controlled by pulling strings - no direct touching allowed once the challenge starts!

## Step-by-Step Instructions:

### Setup (5 minutes):
1. Set up a "building zone" for each team
2. Place 3 cups on the table spread apart
3. Explain the goal: stack all 3 cups into a tower using only the claw
4. Demonstrate: show students a simple grabbing motion (though they'll build their own design)

### Planning Phase (10 minutes):
1. Show students how a claw works:
   - It needs to OPEN to go around the cup
   - It needs to CLOSE to grip the cup
   - Strings control the opening and closing
   
2. Basic claw concepts:
   - **The Gripper:** Two or more "fingers" that come together
   - **The Handle:** Something to hold while operating
   - **The Controls:** Strings that open/close the fingers

### Building Phase (30-35 minutes):

**Design Option 1: Simple Pincher Claw (Easier - Grades 2-3)**

**What you're building:** Two popsicle sticks that work like chopsticks

1. **Create the Fingers:**
   - Take 2 popsicle sticks
   - These will be your grabbing "fingers"

2. **Add the Hinge:**
   - Overlap the sticks at one end (about 1 inch overlap)
   - Wrap a rubber band around the overlap tightly
   - The sticks should be able to open and close like scissors

3. **Add Control Strings:**
   - Tie a string to the end of each stick (the ends that open/close)
   - Make strings about 12-18 inches long
   - Pull strings apart = claw opens
   - Release strings = rubber band pulls claw closed

4. **Add a Handle (optional):**
   - Tape a third popsicle stick perpendicular to the hinge as a handle

**Design Option 2: Multi-Finger Claw (Harder - Grades 4-6)**

**What you're building:** A claw with 3-4 fingers that close around the cup

1. **Create the Base:**
   - Use cardboard to cut a small circle (3-4 inches diameter)
   - This is the "palm" of your claw

2. **Attach the Fingers:**
   - Use 3-4 popsicle sticks as fingers
   - Attach one end of each stick to the edge of the cardboard circle
   - Space them evenly around the circle
   - Use tape or small hinges made from paper clips

3. **Add the Closing Mechanism:**
   - Thread ONE long string through small holes at the tip of each finger
   - OR tie individual strings to each finger
   - When you pull the string(s), all fingers should move inward toward center

4. **Create the Handle:**
   - Attach a long stick or rolled cardboard tube to the center of the base
   - This lets you hold the claw above the cups

5. **Test the Grip:**
   - Pull string = fingers close
   - Release = fingers open (you may need rubber bands to help them spring back)

### Teacher Facilitation:

**During Building (walk around and guide):**
- "Show me how your claw will close. What makes it close?"
- "How will you control it from far away?"
- "Try picking up a cup right now - does it work?"

**Common Issues:**
- **Claw won't close tightly enough:** Add rubber bands to pull fingers together
- **Can't grip the cup:** Make sure fingers curve inward, not straight
- **Cup slips out:** Add texture to fingers (wrap with rubber band, add tape sticky-side-out)
- **Strings tangle:** Use different colors or keep them separated

### Testing Phase (15 minutes):

**The Cup Stack Challenge - Official Rules:**
1. Place 3 cups spread out on the table
2. Using ONLY the claw (no hands touching cups!), stack all 3 cups into a tower
3. Tower must stand for 5 seconds
4. Fastest time wins! (Or award points for successful stacking)

**Scoring Options:**
- **Completion:** Did you successfully stack all 3 cups? (Yes = 10 points)
- **Speed:** How long did it take? (Fastest = bonus points)
- **No Drops:** Stack without dropping any cups (bonus points)
- **Creativity:** Most creative claw design (teacher's choice award)

## Learning Objectives:
- **Simple machines:** Levers and mechanical advantage
- **Cause and effect:** Pulling string causes fingers to close
- **Engineering design:** Iterating to improve grip and control
- **Hand-eye coordination:** Controlling the claw precisely

## Differentiation:
- **Easier:** 
  - Allow stacking just 2 cups
  - Make a simpler 2-stick pincher design
  - Let students touch cups to position them at the start
  
- **Harder:**
  - Stack cups upside-down (narrower opening!)
  - Build a claw that can pick up other objects (small ball, eraser)
  - Add a height requirement: claw must lift cup 6 inches off table

- **Extension Challenge:**
  - Create a claw that can open AND close by pulling different strings (one string opens, one closes)
  - Design a claw with a twisting motion (rotate the cup while holding it)

## Safety Notes:
- Scissors should be used carefully
- If using hot glue, teacher supervision required
- Make sure strings aren't too long (tripping hazard)

## Discussion Questions:
- What made your claw work well? What didn't work?
- How did pulling the string make the fingers move?
- Why was it hard to control the claw?
- Where do you see claws or grippers in real life? (Arcade games, robot arms, construction equipment!)

## Real-World Connections:
- **Robotic arms** in factories use similar gripper mechanisms
- **Arcade claw machines** use this same principle
- **Prosthetic hands** work with similar control systems
- **Construction cranes** have claws for lifting materials

## Troubleshooting Guide:

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Claw won't open | Add rubber bands to pull fingers apart when string is released |
| Claw won't close | Pull string tighter; add more tension with rubber bands |
| Fingers too stiff | Use thinner materials; make hinges looser |
| Can't grip cup | Add rubber bands around fingertips for friction; curve fingers inward |
| String keeps slipping | Tie knots; add tape to secure string to sticks |
| Cup slips out | Hold claw steadier; close fingers more tightly; add texture |
