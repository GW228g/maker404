# Marble Maze Master

**Grade Level:** K-6  
**Time:** 45-60 minutes  
**Group Size:** 2-4 students per team

## Materials Needed (per team):
- 1 piece of sturdy cardboard (pizza box lid, poster board, or similar - about 12" x 12")
- 10-15 popsicle sticks OR cardboard strips (cut from cereal boxes)
- White glue or glue sticks (hot glue for older students with supervision)
- 1 marble (or small ball)
- Tape
- Scissors
- Stopwatch or timer
- Optional: small cup for the "finish zone"

## The Challenge:
Design a tabletop maze where a marble takes AT LEAST 10 seconds to roll from start to finish. The maze must use gravity and have at least 3 obstacles or features that slow the marble down.

## Step-by-Step Instructions:

### Setup (5 minutes):
1. Distribute cardboard bases and materials
2. Show students how to time a marble rolling: start = when you release it, stop = when it reaches the end
3. Demonstrate what "at least 10 seconds" means with a timer
4. Explain that FASTER is not better - SLOWER wins!

### Planning Phase (10 minutes):
1. Have students sketch their maze design on paper first
2. They must plan:
   - Where is START?
   - Where is FINISH?
   - What will slow the marble down?
   
**Ideas to slow the marble:**
- Zigzag paths
- Ramps that go up (marble rolls back down if too steep!)
- Spiral sections
- Narrow passages
- Bumpy sections (glue small items to create texture)
- Loops or curves
- Dead ends that marble must reverse out of

### Building Phase (25-30 minutes):

**Step 1: Mark Start and Finish (2 minutes)**
1. Draw or tape a START zone in one corner
2. Draw or tape a FINISH zone (can be a circle, cup, or marked area)

**Step 2: Build the Walls (15 minutes)**

1. **For Younger Students (K-2):** 
   - Glue or tape popsicle sticks directly to the cardboard to create a winding path
   - Make the path at least 2 marbles wide so it's not too hard
   - Create 2-3 simple turns

2. **For Older Students (3-6):**
   - Create walls that are taller (stack popsicle sticks or fold cardboard strips)
   - Design complex paths with multiple obstacles
   - Add ramps, tunnels, or multi-level sections

**Gluing Tips:**
- White glue needs 1-2 minutes to set - hold pieces in place or use tape temporarily
- Hot glue sets fast but needs adult supervision
- Tape works for quick fixes during building

**Step 3: Add Obstacles (10 minutes)**

Choose at least 3 features:

1. **Zigzag Section:** Create sharp turns with walls
2. **Speed Bump:** Glue a popsicle stick across the path
3. **Ramp:** Prop up one end of cardboard with a book - marble rolls up, then back down
4. **Spiral:** Build walls in a spiral pattern
5. **Narrow Passage:** Make walls close together
6. **Loop-de-loop:** Advanced! Create a curved wall section
7. **False Paths:** Dead ends where marble has to roll backward

**Step 4: Test and Adjust (5 minutes)**
1. Place marble at START
2. Let it roll (gravity only - no pushing!)
3. Time how long it takes
4. Too fast? Add more obstacles or make paths longer
5. Too slow (marble stops)? Widen paths or remove obstacles

### Teacher Tips:
- Encourage testing EARLY - don't wait until the end
- If a marble gets stuck, that spot needs adjustment
- Gravity is the only power - tilting the board is okay, but no pushing the marble
- The marble must be able to complete the course - getting stuck doesn't count!

### Final Competition (10-15 minutes):
1. Each team runs their marble 3 times
2. Time each run
3. Average the 3 times (or take the best run)
4. Marble must complete the course for time to count
5. Team closest to (but over) 10 seconds wins!

## Learning Objectives:
- **Gravity and motion:** How slope affects speed
- **Friction:** Rough surfaces vs. smooth surfaces
- **Spatial reasoning:** Planning a path in limited space
- **Trial and error:** Testing and iterating designs

## Differentiation:
- **Easier:** Require only 5 seconds instead of 10; allow wider paths
- **Harder:** Require exactly 10 seconds (closest wins); marble must pass through 5+ obstacles
- **Extension:** Multi-level maze (marble drops from upper level to lower level)

## Scoring Variations:
- **Time Challenge:** Closest to 10 seconds wins
- **Obstacle Challenge:** Most obstacles that marble successfully navigates wins
- **Creativity Award:** Most unique or creative maze design

## Discussion Questions:
- What slowed your marble down the most?
- Why did the marble speed up on some parts and slow down on others?
- What would happen if you tilted the board? Why?
- How is friction helping and hurting your design?

## Real-World Connections:
- Roller coaster designers use these same principles!
- Highway engineers design roads with curves and slopes
- Pinball machines use gravity and obstacles

## Common Problems & Solutions:
- **Marble goes too fast:** Add more turns, make path longer, add bumps
- **Marble gets stuck:** Widen the path, check for glue bumps, smooth the course
- **Walls fall down:** Use more glue, let glue dry longer, add tape for support
- **Marble jumps the walls:** Walls too short - make them taller, or slow marble down
